Telecom Customer Churn Prediction - A Machine Learning Classification model.

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue using a company's services. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for telecom companies to retain customers and maintain profitability.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset provided by a telecom company, I aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and key factors influencing churn. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and interpretation.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution, relationships, and characteristics of the variables.

Missing Value Handling: Address missing values in the dataset using appropriate imputation or removal techniques.

Feature Engineering: Transform and create new features to enhance the predictive power of the models.

Model Development: Utilize various machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models for customer churn.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Model Interpretation: Interpret the models to understand the factors driving customer churn and their relative importance.
Process
-Pull data from remote database with pyodbc; save as csv files.

-Develop questions and a hypothesis to base analysis of the project on.

-Understand the data and make decisions on how to process the data.

-Data preprocessing, cleaning and merging- The data was very messy and 90% of the project involved cleaning and making the data ready for analysis and visualizations.

-Visualise the data with seaborn and pyplot.

-Created a PowerBI dashboard with the visualizations.

-Wrote a medium article and briefly described the process, findings and recommendations.
